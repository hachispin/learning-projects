# `mdex_tool`

## Description

A basic CLI app that can search for and download manga from [MangaDex](https://mangadex.org).

Some quick links that may be useful:

- https://api.mangadex.org/docs/redoc.html
- https://api.mangadex.org/docs/swagger.html

## Usage

First, clone this repo and checkout `mdex_tool` if you don't wish to include other unrelated projects:

```
git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/hachispin/learning-projects
cd learning-projects
git sparse-checkout init --cone
git sparse-checkout set python/mdex_tool
git checkout main
```

If you wish, you can also tweak the config, `config.toml`, to your liking, which includes important options such as:

- `use_datasaver`
- `include_pornographic`
- `use_ansi`

Info about other options can be found within the config as comments.

Secondly, install the dependencies (3) in `mdex_tool/requirements.txt` like so:

```
pip install -r mdex_tool/requirements.txt
```

Finally, run `mdex_tool/main.py` as a module with the `-m` flag:

```
python3 -m mdex_tool.main
```

Note that this must be done from the parent directory of where `mdex_tool` is located. Windows users should use `py` instead of `python3` here.

You will then be displayed the main menu and further usage instructions.

## Ratelimit handling

Example debug level log; simplified for brevity. This is calling the `GET /manga/random` endpoint.

This endpoint returns a random manga and has a ratelimit of [60 requests per minute](https://api.mangadex.org/docs/2-limitations/#endpoint-specific-rate-limits). More info about what this endpoint returns is on the [redoc](https://api.mangadex.org/docs/redoc.html#tag/Manga/operation/get-manga-random).

```
15:26 Request #61
15:26 [urllib3.connectionpool] https://api.mangadex.org:443 "GET /manga/random HTTP/1.1" 429 174
15:26 [mdex_tool.api.client] Ratelimited (received status code 429)
15:26 [mdex_tool.api.client] X-RateLimit-Retry-After = 1753190169
15:26 [mdex_tool.api.client] Time to sleep: 42 seconds
16:08 [urllib3.connectionpool] Resetting dropped connection: api.mangadex.org

```

- The header, `X-Ratelimit-Retry_after`, is a UNIX timestamp
- Timestamps on the left are in `MIN:SEC`; the time change between lines 5-6 is expected.

## Notes

- Currently, no language other than English is supported. Sorry!

- If you see odd escape codes like `\033[31m‚îÅ\033[0m`, you're using a terminal that doesn't support [ANSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code). To fix this, disable ANSI in `config.toml`, labeled `use_ansi`

- As I haven't implemented [log rotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_rotation) yet, it may be useful to disable logging entirely using the config.

- Chapters with blank chapter number fields are labeled `Ch. Unknown` along with the chapter's title, if it exists. You'll most often see this with [Oneshot](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-shot_(comics)>) genre.

## To-do

- [x] **Give better feedback on when chapters can't be downloaded**
- [x] Add a config file &rarr; _uses config.toml_
- [x] Switch to [requests-futures](https://github.com/ross/requests-futures) or pipe through `curl` for faster download speeds &rarr; _uses [PyCurl](https://github.com/pycurl/pycurl)_
- [ ] **Async image downloading**
- [ ] Log rotations
- [ ] Configurable language filtering ("en" is used internally)
- [ ] Refactor `Manga` and `Chapter` classes to store attributes
- [ ] Sorting by tags and other characteristics of note
- [ ] Chapter sorting by scanlation group and date
