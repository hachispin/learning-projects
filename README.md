# learning-projects

Currently working on: The C++ course [learncpp](https://www.learncpp.com/).

I don't plan on working on any TO-DO lists or existing projects for now.

## Description

A collection of small-ish projects that I don't think should be given seperate repos.

- You can find `README.md` and a `requirements.txt` file (Python) in each project folder.

Some of the code here might be _questionable_, but I do try and refactor from time to time.

## What to run?

The entry point should be formatted as such:

`learning-projects/[language]/[projectName]/main.[ext]`

Some Python projects need to be run as modules with the `-m` flag. This should be documented in their READMEs.
