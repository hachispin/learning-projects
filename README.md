# learning-projects

Currently working on: `mangadex-dl`'s [to-do list](python/mangadex-dl/README.md#to-do)

## Description

A collection of small-ish projects that I don't think should be given seperate repos.

- You can find `README.md` files in each project folder.

Some of the code here might be _questionable_, but I do try and refactor from time to time.

## What to run?

The entry point should be formatted as such:

`learning-projects/[language]/[projectName]/main.[ext]`
