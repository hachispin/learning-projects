# learning-projects
## Description
A collection of small-ish projects that I don't think should be given seperate repos.
- You can find `README.md` files in each project folder.

Some of the code here might be *questionable*, but I do try and refactor from time to time. 

## What to run?
The entry point should be formatted as such: 

`learning-projects/[language]/[projectName]/[projectName].[ext]`
